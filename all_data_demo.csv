100642826935648302747,Tommy Britt,Chevrolet of South Anchorage,1.0,"Went to the dealership looking for a new Tahoe and to trade in my vehicle. The salesman I worked with was ok, I told him exactly what I was looking for and he showed me it. After I left the dealership with my Tahoe I was leaving a week after that and driving out of state. I knew it would take maybe a week for the payoff to come on the Subaru, however several weeks passed by, I was about to have to make the payment on the Subaru I no longer owned and also the Tahoe I had in my possession. When I called and spoke with the finance department I was a little irritated, what made it worse was the person I was talking to told me I should feel lucky I had the Tahoe and that it took a lot for them to get me in it. If I had been in state I would have loved to take the Tahoe back and throw them the keys. After the payoff finally went through on the subaru, I went ahead and got refinance at a much lower rate and lower payment with my bank instead of gm financial, thank you northern skies. So on to the next story, I turned in paperwork (which took three days for them to email to me) to cancel my over priced gap insurance and my over priced extended warranty with them a couple weeks ago, still have yet to hear anything back and now Calvin I believe his name is, won't return my phone calls or an email. I sat on the phone on hold for 15 minutes with a dealership that never has anyone in it, was hung up on before talking to someone, then when I called back all I got was a voicemail. Still waiting to hear something! Overall I would not suggest buying anything from these people, not because of their sales department but because their finance team needs to work on their customer service. If I did my job as slowly as them and still made mistakes I wouldn't have a job anymore.",2018-07-30 01:11:50,1532884310709,0x56c899c55b426f17:0x279f14fc828309cc,"Chevrolet of South Anchorage, 9100 Old Seward Hwy, Anchorage, AK 99515",,61.1381187,-149.8663481,4.3,978,,,https://www.google.com/maps/place//data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x56c899c55b426f17:0x279f14fc828309cc?authuser=-1&hl=en&gl=us,Chevrolet dealer | Car dealer | Truck dealer | Used car dealer,0,2018-07-31 03:01:16,"Tommy, we're sorry to hear about your experience.

They are always pleasant, helpful, go out of their way to make things better, it is truly impressive.  The beds are comfortable, firm yet soft and the linens are nice.  I always find my room sparkling clean, but there was a slight damp feel to my most recent room.  The breakfast includes cereals, toast, muffins, donuts, yogurts, hard boiled eggs, and waffle machines.  The eggs and sausage patties are quite disappointing unfortunately but coffee is good and available around the clock.  The hotel manager has written to me in the past and was very accommodating and helped me book my second stay. The exterior appearance of the hotel is not particularly welcoming but it has been renovated on the interior and is more than you would expect from the outside appearance.

Edgar was super nice and when he wasn't sure of the answers ty questions Tyler came and was also super helpful! They didn't think to check if there were any ""open box"" specials for me and while we were looking at the TV wall mount options I noticed the""open box"" specials in the same aisle. It just so happened the same TV I was considering purchasing was there! Yay I was able to purchase it for a little more savings and still get the same warranty and options. Lastly, if you're upgrading from an older TV like I was, you will need to ask them about which cords you'll need to run your components...they surprisingly even suggested I contact check Amazon for cheaper options. Overall, I was super impressed with the customer service and definitely recommend going there. Be prepared to spend at least an hour and get educated.

117710792511826342728,ashley adkins,Yellowstone Naturopathic Clinic,3.0,"I had a terrible experience at the day spa inside the clinic. I went to get a brazillian (which I've had done many many times before, elsewhere) and it was the worst experience of my life (seriously not exaggerating). I left there barely able to walk and when I got home immediately had to sit on an ice pack because of how red and swollen and painful things ""down there"" were. It's two days out and I am bruised all over (my labia, perineum, and ""between the checks""). My bikini area is also bruised. I can barely walk it hurts so bad. Even going to the bathroom is a struggle. And lastly, there is still so much hair left down there! Completely disappointed and will never go back to their esthetician for anything. If this had been my first time getting a brazillian I would think it was all ""normal"" but since I've had them many times before I know this is not the norm.
**update - the spa called me and allowed me to talk to them about my experience and immediately offered me a refund. They were very apologetic and said this had never happened in the past and that it would be taken care of even though my experience wasn't good, I'm grateful they called me to talk about it and ""fix"" my experience. I can't say I would go back to their esthetician, however the integrity of the spa is very high and maybe I'll try s different service they offer :)",2018-01-25 03:29:13,1516822153180,0x53487b393730c4ed:0xbde55635badf8d5f,"Yellowstone Naturopathic Clinic, 720 N 30th St, Billings, MT 59101",,45.7865891,-108.5141919,4.1,28,,Closed ‚ãÖ Opens 9AM,https://www.google.com/maps/place//data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x53487b393730c4ed:0xbde55635badf8d5f?authuser=-1&hl=en&gl=us,Chiropractor,0,,,,"{""Tuesday"":""9AM‚Äì7PM"",""Wednesday"":""9AM‚Äì5PM"",""Thursday"":""9AM‚Äì5PM"",""Friday"":""9AM‚Äì5PM"",""Saturday"":""Closed"",""Sunday"":""Closed"",""Monday"":""9AM‚Äì5PM""}","{""Accessibility"":[""Wheelchair accessible entrance""],""Planning"":[""Appointments recommended""]}",0x53487ca5acb7d381:0x18135b711d82b19 | 0x53487048abb2ffe9:0x47eb23486e20bdb6 | 0x53487b307e617b2d:0x89ddeda64cb9c240 | 0x53487b3eab8cc243:0x8b4e734de8bf19d2 | 0x534863703dde673d:0x7edd28af1ee8f9c9

112003402683863396652,K Kwan,Terry Bison Ranch Resort,5.0,Oh man. It was a spur of the moment decision to stop here and I am so glad we did. I wanted to see wild bison and I got my wish. This was my first time to Wyoming and the first thing I did. The train was a little noisy but I could still hear the announcer over the PA system. Feeding the bison was so much fun and there were so many babies! The guide said there were around 21 babies and they were so cute! The Trading Post was clean and the staff friendly and helpful. Lots of souvenirs as well. The horses are beautiful and there are lots of other animals as well. It was a good choice to stop there.,2020-06-19 06:08:09,1592518089204,0x876f2918549651ff:0xc909a7446f29bbaa,"Terry Bison Ranch Resort, 51 I-25 Frontage Rd, Cheyenne, WY 82007","Rustic cabins on an enduring bison ranch with train tours & horseback riding, plus a steakhouse.",41.002541,-104.9045363,4.3,1444,,,https://www.google.com/maps/place//data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x876f2918549651ff:0xc909a7446f29bbaa?authuser=-1&hl=en&gl=us,Dude ranch | Gift shop | Horse boarding stable | Tour agency | Tourist attraction,7,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8J1JkSFat5JaGISAB0Rgfpedba9nOQrSx1raj=w150-h150-k-no-p | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8fgwHo-5JipLQrW3dKx6U7gNCKRG7lKsGni9H=w150-h150-k-no-p | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm6ltIyzkYeS-v9S3o0XNzzZhhQ6K88Uz7WH5l=w150-h150-k-no-p | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDsdEM73zcETGn5WG8UCQPmxELaCPkvVV2BezX=w150-h150-k-no-p | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjXvbpKmQIS3Fn5cSwQQgGgmJIsg1jDFpWV7li=w150-h150-k-no-p | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9q5NIjVIGrK8jLJE58H4A-4894KKV1aKhLSG8=w150-h150-k-no-p | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiDI1xCCuQ_l5I7xEG23cMORHVGn_1sTDaPbcK=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,
